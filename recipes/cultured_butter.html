    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Rich and nutritious, cultured butter develops the cream usually used for butter with a culture of buttermilk for up to a week in advance,<br>
    allowing natural processes to develop deeper flavor and texture. Once mixed, the buttermilk can be saved to use for future batches.</p>
    <h2>Time Investment</h2>
    <p>35 minutes active : 5 minutes prep, 1-7 days culture, 30 minutes mix</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Tools: Stand mixer,rubber spatula, cheesecloth, storage container</li>
            <li>Heavy cream, as much as you like</li>
            <li>1/4 cup of cultured buttermilk</li>
            <li>Kosher salt</li>
            <li>Ice cubes</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Pour your heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer and add your buttermilk culture. <br>
            Stir slightly, cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let sit for up to a week.<br>
            The longer it sits, the stronger the flavor it will develop. </li>
        <li>When you're ready to make your butter, place the bowl back into the stand mixer and beat it<br>
        on medium speed with a whisk attachment. As the fats begin to cluster, the butter will separate from the buttermilk.</li>
        <li>When it fully separates, prepare the cheesecloth in a bowl and begin pouring the mixture out,<br>
        letting the cheesecloth hold back the solids. Set aside any of the buttermilk that you wish to keep,<br>
        discard or use the rest</li>
        <li>Gently squeeze the cheesecloth around the butter solids, squeezing out large pockets of fluid</li>
        <li>Turn the cheesecloth inside out and gather the solids into a large mixing bowl</li>
        <li>Fill the bowl with cold water and begin kneading and smearing the butter in the bowl with the rubber spatula<br>
            Add ice cubes to keep the butter solid in the water during this process</li>
        <li>As you smear and knead the butter, it will release small pockets of buttermilk into the water.<br>
        As the water becomes cloudy, pour it out and refill the bowl. Repeat as needed until kneading the butter<br>
        leaves the water totally clear.</li>
        <li>Pour out all of the water and knead the butter to release the clean water left behind.<br>
        Water left in the butter will reduce its shelf life.Add flakes of salt during this process<br>
         to spread them through the butter and improve the flavor.</li>
        <li>Pack it into containers and store it in the refrigerator. The flavor will continue to develop<br>
        while the butter stays at room temperature.</li>
    </ol>
